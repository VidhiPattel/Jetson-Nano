# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection using CNN on Jetson Nano
This is a project for detecting diabetic retinopathy using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and implemented on Jetson Nano.
# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection from Kaggle. The dataset contains retinal images that were graded for diabetic retinopathy on a scale of 0 to 4, where 0 indicates no diabetic retinopathy and 4 indicates the presence of severe diabetic retinopathy.
# Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following:

* Python 3
* Tensorflow 2
* Keras
* OpenCV
* Jetson Nano

# Usage
1. Download the https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection dataset from Kaggle and extract it to the dataset folder.
2.
